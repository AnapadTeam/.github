An anapad combines the keyboard and trackpad into a single device so that all the computer peripherals a user needs are directly under their fingertips. Using haptic feedback and force sensing technology, an anapad enables a user to physically perceive dynamic input interfaces. Additionally, software applications can configure an anapad to display custom interfaces.

Our first generation anapad is called Model A, which consists of a multi-touch, multi-color widescreen LCD display housed in an aluminum enclosure. Internally, Model A contains 33 linear resonant actuators (LRAs) to provide haptic feedback and 4 strain gauge force sensors to perceive touch pressure.
